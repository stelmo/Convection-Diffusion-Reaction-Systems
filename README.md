Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Systems
=====================================

### The analysis and implementation of coupled convection diffusion reaction systems with the finite element method.
All the programs were done in the Julia Language.

# One Dimensional Analysis
Piecewise linear basis functions are used exclusively (Straight line elements).

## Steady State Systems
The Aris-Taylor approximation is used to model radial diffusion with axial diffusion and convection. First order kinetics are used.

## Unsteady Systems

# Two Dimensional Analysis
Piecewise bilinear basis functions are used exclusively (Square elements).

## Steady State Systems
Axial diffusion with radial diffusion and convection. First order kinetics are used.

## Unsteady Systems
