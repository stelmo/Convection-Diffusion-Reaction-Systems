Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Systems
=====================================

### The analysis and implementation of coupled convection diffusion reaction systems with the finite element method.

## One Dimensional Analysis

# Steady State Systems
The Aris-Taylor approximation is used to model radial diffusion with axial diffusion and convection. First order kinetics are used.

# Unsteady Systems

## Two Dimensional

# Steady State Systems
Axial diffusion with radial diffusion and convection. First order kinetics are used.

# Unsteady Systems
